# A New Beginning

Hello,

My name is Kyle and welcome to my new project!

This might look and feel like just another blog post to you, but to me, it is much more than that. It is a jumping-off point, a milestone, and an “I finally got over my self-doubt and did it” kind of thing. I got over the feelings of “I’m not good enough to share anything of value with others” and put fingers to keys, ideas into existence, and creative thoughts into digital graphics and designs.

I bet that you have some reservations about yourself as well. Maybe it is holding you back from doing something truly great for yourself and others. I get goosebumps seeing people doing something they love and sharing that thing with whoever might stumble upon it or be interested. This is that thing for me and it is hopefully a resource or inspiration that can help you along the way to sharing something you love with others.

After some road bumps and hard lessons learned in my young adult life, I found my way to a profession and skill set that I was passionate about. I have always had a love for technology and found myself fascinated with websites and web applications. The idea that anyone in the world can claim a spot in the World Wide Web and get their ideas, products, or tools in front of anyone with an internet connection blew my mind. I wanted to learn how websites and the technology used to create them worked.

After doing a small amount of self-studying and proving to myself that this was really something I wanted to pursue, I began studying Software Development at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College. During my 3 year journey to achieve my associate’s degree I married, had two kids, worked full-time as an industrial pressure washer and CNC machinist, and self-studied Web Development.

## Hard Work Paid Off

During my last year of college, I felt that my web development skills were at a point where I was ready to do something with them. Starting a legitimate business has always intrigued me, so I set out on my first venture. I picked a name, ZimmTekk, created a shoddy logo using Canva, and threw together a website. Here is a picture of those efforts, you probably wouldn’t hire me based on this, would you!

It is actually gratifying to look back on this and see how far I have come since then. The crazy thing is, people did hire me after seeing this website. Lesson learned is that starting something is always better than doing nothing!

I landed a few clients from Craigslist and Facebook, continued working on my skills, and eventually put together a much better website using WordPress and a theme called Divi. Here is what that looked like.

After deciding to quit my full-time job as a CNC machine operator in October 2018 to stay home with my newborn son and 3-year-old daughter, I was struggling to stay focused and couldn’t figure out a good way to consistently get new business. It wasn’t a failure, but it definitely wasn’t enough to support my family. I graduated from college and decided to take a full-time job as a Wordpress Designer/Developer at Amplified Digital Agency which I started in early June 2019.

I am still happily employed there. My skill progression is similar to the drastic differences you saw between the 2 ZimmTekk websites. I have had the privilege to design and develop over 20 sites for small business owners in less than a year. I would share some images, but because I am not sure if I have the permission to do so you will just have to take my word on this part.

Taking a job doesn’t mean I am a failure at entrepreneurship, and even if it does, failing is an important part of entrepreneurship. You learn so many lessons from failing and I think it is taking those lessons, picking yourself back up, and giving it another go that makes an entrepreneur successful. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, and taking a full-time job has allowed me to use and grow my skill set while collecting a steady paycheck and benefits to provide for my family.

## What's Next?

What’s next? This is something I have been asking myself lately. While I love my job and the people I work with, I am not particularly fond of the technology I am using to create websites. WordPress is a solid platform and has been for over 10 years, but I think there is a phase shift occurring in the industry at this very moment.

* Sharing my knowledge with others - I see people trying to do something with what they are passionate about, and many of them need help navigating the new way of starting a business digitally.
* Other things I love that are loosely related to the main topic.
* Offering my skill set as a service for small business owners and startups that are serious.

## Help Me Help You

* Feedback is very important to me at this and every stage
